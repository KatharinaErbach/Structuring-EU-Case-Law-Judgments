# Structuring-EU-Case-Law-Judgments

The reseach internship is related to the Maastrichtuniversity Law and Tech lab. We focused on an approach to structure the eurpean case law judgments, freely availabe on the EUR-Lex webpage. We introduce a headline extraction method, combined with a k-means clustering algorithm in order to generate document wide categories. Those categories were the used to generate LDA topic models. Based on those topics every cluster gets an topic in order to find related documents.
We finally present everything in a local HTML webpage.
