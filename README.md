# Structuring-EU-Case-Law-Judgments

Hello together,

My research internship is coming to an end and as a result I have designed an HTML page to structure the EU (case law) Judgments. In order to get a basic structure, I first extracted the headlines and related blocks of each document and then grouped these headlines into 8 categories using k-means clustering: Keywords, Judgment, Summary, Legal, Facts, Grounds, Costs and Operative Part. 
Now you have the possibility to filter the judgments according to (so far) three options and to have suggestions for comparable judgments displayed. 
These options are: a) by subject, given by the EU, b) by citations, c) by generated topics for each category, based on a LDA model.
The HTML page is currently running locally and you are welcome to download and try it out here, by downloading the webpage files.
